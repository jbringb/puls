# Puls

Device uptime and status monitoring server, written in Go 1.25+. Devices register,
hold a persistent WebSocket connection, and send periodic heartbeats with basic
system diagnostics. The server can also query connected devices for detailed,
on-demand diagnostics and streams events to subscribers over SSE.

**Module:** `github.com/jbringb/puls`

## Build, run, test

```bash
go build -o puls-server ./cmd/puls-server   # build
go test ./...                               # run all tests
go vet ./...                                # vet

# run (listens on :8080) — JWT_SECRET signs tokens; ADMIN_SECRET mints admin tokens (must differ)
PULS_JWT_SECRET="at-least-32-characters-long" PULS_ADMIN_SECRET="separate-admin-password" ./puls-server
```

In-memory SQLite by default (data lost on restart). Set `PULS_DB_PATH` for file-backed
SQLite, or `DATABASE_URL` (standard Postgres URL) to use the Postgres backend instead.

## Key dependencies

- `modernc.org/sqlite` — pure-Go SQLite driver (no CGO)

## Conventions

### General
- Use `log/slog` everywhere — JSON in production, text in development
- Wrap public errors with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`
- No global state — pass dependencies explicitly via constructors
- All database calls take a `context.Context` with a deadline
- Prefer table-driven tests in `_test.go` files alongside the code
- Schema changes: append a new entry to both `migrations` in `store/sqlite.go`
  (tracked by `PRAGMA user_version`) and `pgMigrations` in `store/postgres.go`
  (tracked by `puls_schema_version` table). Never edit a released migration.
  SQLite runs in WAL mode. Postgres uses `TIMESTAMPTZ` and `BYTEA` for SQLite's
  `TEXT`-timestamps and `BLOB` respectively.

### Naming
- Exported types `PascalCase`; unexported `camelCase`
- Constructors: `NewXxx(deps...) (*Xxx, error)`
- HTTP handler methods on a struct: `func (s *Server) handleXxx(w, r)`
- No hyphens in identifiers, JSON keys, URL path segments, or file names.
  camelCase for JSON fields, lowercase-no-separator URL segments
  (`/api/v1/devices`), underscores allowed in file names (`routes_device.go`)

### HTTP
- Standard `net/http` `ServeMux` with Go 1.22+ method+path patterns
- All JSON responses use `application/json`
- Non-2xx responses return `{"error": "message"}`
- Decode bodies with `json.NewDecoder` + `DisallowUnknownFields()`
- List endpoints use cursor-based pagination (`?limit=&cursor=`), not offset —
  see `GET /api/v1/devices` and `internal/store/cursor.go`. The cursor encodes
  the last row's sort key(s), base64'd and opaque to clients.
- Diagnostic requests have a derived `status` (`pending`/`completed`/`timed_out`,
  see `diagnosticStatus` in `routes_diagnostics.go`) instead of relying on a
  nil payload alone — a device can disconnect between delivery and
  responding, so "no payload yet" can't otherwise distinguish "still working"
  from "will never answer". `PULS_DIAGNOSTIC_TIMEOUT` (default 60s) controls
  when a request flips to `timed_out`; the row isn't deleted, so a late
  response still lands. A request whose delivery fails synchronously (encode
  or send error) is deleted immediately instead of waiting out the timeout.

### WebSocket
- Messages are JSON envelopes: `{"type":"...","requestId":"...","data":{...}}`
- Message types: `heartbeat`, `diag_request`, `diag_response`, `error`
- Clients must heartbeat within 90 seconds or the connection is closed
- Inbound messages are rate-limited per device (5 msg/s, burst 20); a device
  that exceeds it gets an `error` envelope back, not a dropped connection
- Auth on upgrade, in order of preference: `Authorization: Bearer`, the
  `puls.bearer` subprotocol (`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: puls.bearer, <token>`),
  then `?token=` (fallback only — leaks into logs)
- Browser origins restricted via `PULS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (default: same-origin only)

### Observability
- Prometheus metrics at `GET /metrics` (unauthenticated, rate-limited 2 req/s per IP)
  — custom registry in `internal/observability`; isolated from the default registry
- `GET /healthz` — liveness (process up); `GET /readyz` — readiness (DB ping)
- OTel tracing via `PULS_OTEL_ENDPOINT` (also `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`); no-op
  if unset so local runs require no collector. `otelhttp.NewHandler` wraps the server
  when the endpoint is set.
- Key metrics: `puls_http_requests_total{method,route,status}`,
  `puls_http_request_duration_seconds{method,route}`, `puls_heartbeats_total`,
  `puls_devices_connected` (GaugeFunc backed by `hub.Count()`),
  `puls_ws_messages_rejected_total` (per-device WS rate limit, see Security)

### Security
- JWT signing: HS256. Signing key from `PULS_JWT_SECRET` (min 32 chars)
- Admin tokens are minted by presenting `PULS_ADMIN_SECRET` (min 16 chars) — a
  password distinct from the signing key, compared with `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`.
  Never authenticate against the signing key itself; that would let an admin forge tokens.
- Device JWTs expire after 90 days; admin tokens after 24 hours
- Registration secrets hashed with bcrypt (cost 12) before storage
- Always validate the `Origin` header on WebSocket upgrades
- Rate limiting uses `internal/server/keyedRateLimiter`, a token bucket keyed by
  an arbitrary string — client IP for the public HTTP endpoints (`rateLimit`
  middleware), device ID for inbound WebSocket messages (`Server.wsLimiter`,
  checked in `ws.Client.Run` via the `allowMessage` callback). Per-device, not
  per-IP, so devices sharing a NAT/proxy IP don't share a bucket, and one
  flooding device can't starve another's.
- The Docker image runs as `65534:65534` ("nobody" — the conventional
  non-root placeholder UID/GID; `scratch` has no `/etc/passwd`, so it's used
  numerically), not root, to limit the blast radius of a container escape or
  a leaked capability. The builder stage pre-creates and `chown`s `/data`
  so a named volume mounted there for file-backed SQLite inherits that
  ownership on first mount — see the Dockerfile's comments and the README's
  Docker section for the operator-facing side of this.

## Workflow

- Do **not** run `git push` — the user pushes manually.
